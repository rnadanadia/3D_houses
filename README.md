# Description
The 3D project goal is to create a house model in 3D with only a home address using lidar file. The process begins by doing geotransform from .tif file then get the information of the longitude and latitude from the address using API keys. Followed by calculating CHM (Canopy Height Model) as Z value to plot 3D house.
